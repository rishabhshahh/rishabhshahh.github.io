## Making Sense of Crime in Chicago

This public dashboard explores crime in Chicago over the past year using data from the city's open data portal. Our central visualization focuses on theft, the most frequently reported crime. The trendline reveals seasonal variation in theft activity, with peaks during the holiday months and dips in the warmer summer periods. This interactive chart helps users intuitively observe how theft evolves over time.

To add broader context, we also explore the top 10 crime types, revealing that battery, criminal damage, and assault follow closely behind theft. These categories show where police resources are likely most needed. We also dive into arrest rates by crime type, crimes like narcotics and weapons violations have much higher arrest rates than property crimes, which may suggest a focus on proactive enforcement rather than reactive response.

Together, these visualizations provide a clear and accessible view of how crime is distributed, reported, and addressed in Chicago. They serve as tools for both concerned citizens and policymakers looking to make informed, data-driven decisions.
